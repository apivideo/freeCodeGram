# Welcome to the apiVidstaGram demo

This is a community of fellow developers and we love that you have joined us.

This demo is built on the work of Victor Gonzalez's freeCodeGram project. The change
is a tweak to allow you to upload videos with api.video, then display them alongside
your images on your own version of the social media platform Instagram.

All the best,<br>
Erikka
